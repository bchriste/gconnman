gconnman is a gobject library for interacting with connman.

gconnman aims to be more than just a thin wrapper around the connman d-bus api.

gconnman provices GObject wrappers for each of Connman's d-bus objects exposing:
* per-property getters/setters and gsignals
* GObject-like API's for calling connman methods
