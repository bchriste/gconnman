gconnman is a GObject-like convenienve library for interacting with connman.

*NOTE* - The gconnman API, much like the connman d-bus interface, is constantly
changing. Once connman 1.0 has been released with a stable API we'll start
to think about a guaranteed API for gconnman.

gconnman aims to be more than just a thin wrapper around the connman d-bus api
and provides GObject wrappers for each of Connman's d-bus objects exposing:
* per-property getters/setters and signals
* GObject-like API's for calling connman methods
* Convenience methods to simplify ConnMan method calls,
   i.e cm_manager_connect_wifi ()
